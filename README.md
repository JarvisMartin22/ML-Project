For this project I went through the following process, 

1.) web scraped data from 1950 - 2018 from national climate Data center and stored in a postgres DB. 
2.) then cleaned data partially with Postgres/Postico along with Panadas, converting datetime/duration/sate description and average values
3.) created ML model incorporating a logistic regression, grid search and random forest. Unfortunetly I didn't apply to my data set, but I did discover significant factors. 
4.) displayed data with Tableau driving key insights around EF scale and trends associated with it. 

Overall project went well, however I wish I had more time to finish the ML part. I would incorporate an ARIMA model to predecit future values.
Additionally, I'd like to branch out and incorporate hurricane's in addion, as I learned through research that a good portion of southern/outlier tornadoe's are caused from Hurricane's.
